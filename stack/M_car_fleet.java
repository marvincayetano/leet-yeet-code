// Car fleet problem
// Possible solution: sort the cars by position, then calculate the time to
// reach the target
// Cars travelling next to each other is called car fleet / convoy / caravan
// The one travelling ahead is the leader which determines the speed of the
// fleet
// For example if the leader is slower than the follower, the follower will
// change its speed

// Single car is also a car fleet

// Determine the number of car fleets is the problem
