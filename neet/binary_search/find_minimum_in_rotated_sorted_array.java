// Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

// [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
// [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
// Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

// Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.



// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
// Example 3:

// Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
// Output: 11
// Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.


// Constraints:

// n == nums.length
// 1 <= n <= 5000
// -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
// All the integers of nums are unique.
// nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

// Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

// Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

// Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.



// Example 1:

// Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
// Output: 4
// Example 2:

// Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5

// Example 3:

// Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
